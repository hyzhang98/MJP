# Maximum Joint Probability with Multiple Representations for Clustering

This repository is our implementation of 

[Rui Zhang, Hongyuan Zhang, and X. Li, "Maximum Joint Probability With Multiple Representations for Clustering," *IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning  Systems*, 2021](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9354038).

The core idea is to **learn weights of different views based on which view fits the prior distribution better**. The framework starts from a Bayesian aspect and we show the connection between the proposed maximum joint probability and some existing clustering methods.
